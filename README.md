A port of Arrows to Typescript for Promises for creating compuations.

This library is quite complex, however, that complexity might be worth it
when you are dealing with complex pipelines of async computations, especially
if parts of that pipeline are dynamic.

See more documentation in the file src/computation.ts of available methods or
the related paper http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/arrows.pdf.

TODO:
Add more documentation
